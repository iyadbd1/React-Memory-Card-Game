# Memory Card Game - TOP React Project #2

## Game Goal and Rules

You have a set of _cards_ about some popular books, when you click a card your score increments, the goal is to select all books but _only once_ which requires you to memorize each book you select (clicked), if you click a book twice your score is reset to zero, and you can see your current score and best scores on the top.
